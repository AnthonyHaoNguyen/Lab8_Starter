Graceful degradation and service workers makes a stronger web applications. Graceful degradation designs applications to work under optimal conditions but degrade smoothly when certain capabilities, like JavaScript or internet connection are missing. Service workers support graceful degradation by enabling offline functionality and faster load times. They can intercept network requests to the internet and when the network is slow or unavailable it can give us the cached content, allowing the core parts of an application to remain usable, ensuring that the user experience degrades gracefully rather than breaking entirely.
